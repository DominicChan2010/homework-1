      <h1 class="title">Healthy breakfasts</h1>
      <p>
        Breakfast is an important meal of the day, no matter what critics say.
        It gives you energy to go for the day!
      </p>
      <p>
        However, different countries and regions in the world have different meals,
        so it would be reasonable to say that they have different breakfasts.
      </p>
      <p>
        Today, we will be focusing on the common types of healthy breakfasts that
        we encounter the most.

      <h3 class="subtitle">Light Western Breakfast</h3>

      <br/>
      <p>
        This is the type of breakfast that you normally see in hotels,
        but Westerners eat them as a light breakfast. The classics
        <i>usually</i> have tomatoes, onions, lettuce, and ham inside, but it varies.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a matter of fact, over 60 popular sandwich types originated in America. American subs, BLTs,
        pimento cheese sandwiches, and ham and Swiss sandwiches are among the most famous varieties.
        <u>Note: Burgers are also a subset of sandwiches.</u>

      </p>
      <p>
        This is the type of breakfast that we eat as a staple.
        Although it is not necessarily our breakfast <b><i>all</i></b> the time, it is still present.
      </p>
      <p>
        As the caption suggests, Claypot Chicken Rice is cooked using a clay pot, because they retain
        heat easily. However, it is also costly to buy a traditional clay pot, so many home cooks
        use a pan to do it. In earlier times, it was also not bought, but made as part of pottery.

      <h3 class="subtitle">Malaysian Medium-Light Breakfast</h3>

      </p>
      <p>
        This is the breakfast that people in Malaysia eat. Some eat it with bare hands (like the Indians),
        or eat it with a fork and spoon (most other people). The first person to make this was an Indonesian.

      <h2>So...<h2>
      <p>
        These are some of the healthy breakfasts you can see wherever you go.
      <p>
      <p>
        However, bear in mind that these are not all of the breakfasts in the world:
        It would be a team effort to collect every single one of them. ]
