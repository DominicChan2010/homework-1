      <h1 class="title">Healthy breakfasts</h1>
      <p>
        Breakfast is an important meal of the day, no matter what critics say.
        It gives you energy to go for the day!
      </p>
      <p>
        However, different countries and regions in the world have different meals,
        so it would be reasonable to say that they have different breakfasts.
      </p>
      <p>
        Today, we will be focusing on the common types of healthy breakfasts that
        we encounter the most.

        This is the type of breakfast that you normally see in hotels,
        but Westerners eat them as a light breakfast. The classics
        <i>usually</i> have tomatoes, onions, lettuce, and ham inside, but it varies.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a matter of fact, over 60 popular sandwich types originated in America. American subs, BLTs,
        pimento cheese sandwiches, and ham and Swiss sandwiches are among the most famous varieties.
        <u>Note: Burgers are also a subset of sandwiches.</u>

      <p>
        This is the type of breakfast that we eat as a staple.
        Although it is not necessarily our breakfast <b><i>all</i></b> the time, it is still present.
      </p>
      <p>
        As the caption suggests, Claypot Chicken Rice is cooked using a clay pot, because they retain
        heat easily. However, it is also costly to buy a traditional clay pot, so many home cooks
        use a pan to do it. In earlier times, it was also not bought, but made as part of pottery.
