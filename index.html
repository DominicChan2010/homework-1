      <h1 class="title">Healthy breakfasts</h1>
      <p>
        Breakfast is an important meal of the day, no matter what critics say.
        It gives you energy to go for the day!
      </p>
      <p>
        However, different countries and regions in the world have different meals,
        so it would be reasonable to say that they have different breakfasts.
      </p>
      <p>
        Today, we will be focusing on the common types of healthy breakfasts that
        we encounter the most.

        This is the type of breakfast that you normally see in hotels,
        but Westerners eat them as a light breakfast. The classics
        <i>usually</i> have tomatoes, onions, lettuce, and ham inside, but it varies.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a matter of fact, over 60 popular sandwich types originated in America. American subs, BLTs,
        pimento cheese sandwiches, and ham and Swiss sandwiches are among the most famous varieties.
